# OpenAM-SAMLSP-updateDynamicUser

* OpenAM SP SAML Attribute extension  <br />
* OpenAM Dynamic user profile feature allows OpenAM (acting as SAML SP) to dynamically create users but these users attributes are not updated if they are updated on IdP side. More details in *[OPENAM-8340](https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-8340)* <br />
* This extension resolves this issue. Note that a better solution may include to have something like IDM to sync attributes between IdP and SP.
